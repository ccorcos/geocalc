# GeoCalc - Interactive Geometry Calculator

A modern web-based geometry application that lets you draw shapes and apply constraints, then uses gradient descent optimization to solve for the geometry that satisfies all constraints simultaneously.

## ðŸŽ¯ What is GeoCalc?

GeoCalc is an interactive 2D geometry tool where you can:
- **Draw** points, lines, and circles on a canvas
- **Apply constraints** like fixed distances, parallel lines, perpendicularity
- **Solve** the constraint system using numerical optimization
- **Get real-time feedback** as the solver adjusts your geometry

Unlike traditional CAD tools that use algebraic constraint solving, GeoCalc uses a numerical gradient descent approach that's simpler to implement and extend.

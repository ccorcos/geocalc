Notes
- shift+tab to auto-accept, and plan mode.
- @file will incluude the file without haveing to read them.
- claude --resume
- `#` will add to memory will in Claude.md

Strategies:
- make a plan in plans/yada.md.

zoom fit should include labels and also provide a 10% margin of space.

I should be able to set the initial scale of the drawing so that all the shapes are an appropriate size.


migration strategy, versioning 1, 2, 3...

save / load to a file you can keep on your computer. or serialize to a url parameter string for sharing...


Extrapolate system architecture into a boilerplate for a project.


---

Saving documents. Import / Export. Automerge. Undo/redo. Collaboration.

selecting all and moving it moves the labels wrong. moving a label with its corresponding point should not move the label exactly...

- better colors. red vs green.

Line length constrating. Distance.

fixed radius + point on circle / tangent line

colinear (3+ points, or a line + points)
orthoganol-distance (line + point)
same-length (2+ lines)
same-radius (2+ circles)
bisector, midpoint (custom fraction though?)


Make sure this works on an iPad with a stylus. Right click with apple pencil?

The numbers in the legend seem blurry.

?Works yet?
Three points should be able to have a fixed angle


There should be a constraint to handle ambiguities. Maybe one value is larger than another or something. When there is more than one solution...

When I have two points that have a distance constraint, sometimes the point overshoots and ends up on the other side of the fixed point.


Testing...
I should be able to edit all the numbers in the panels
I should be able to cmd+click to fix things in place.
Tooltip hover takes to long to appear.
Give everything a little more of an Ivan Sutherland Sketchpad feel. I don't want to make my eyes bleed though so make it tasteful.

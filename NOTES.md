In the center panel above the canvas, add the folllwing.

"GeoCalc.com | [Source code](github.com/ccorcos/geocalc) | [Report a bug or ask for help](https://github.com/ccorcos/geocalc/issues)"


Deploy to github pages npm command (don't use github actions ci.)


---

More tools for later. Right click, new entity or constraint or something...
- bisector, midpoint (custom fraction though?)


Support undo/redo, just for state changes to geometry.

selection doesnt get set on mousedown. only mousemove / mouseup. That way clicking the background to make the constraint menu go away doesnt clear the selection before the menu disappears.


Create a panel on the far left that lists all the different files ordered by recently viewed. The save/load/reset functionality can call go in that panel too. I should be able to toggle that panel open and closed.




Make sure this works on an iPad with a stylus. Right click with apple pencil?
Make an app icon thing, make it work offline.


There should be a constraint to handle ambiguities. Maybe one value is larger than another or something. When there is more than one solution...

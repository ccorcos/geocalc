Support undo/redo, just for state changes to geometry.

The same constraints that apply to two points should also apply to a line, like distance.


New constraints.
colinear (3+ points, or a line + points)
orthoganol-distance (line + point)
same-length (2+ lines)
same-radius (2+ circles)
bisector, midpoint (custom fraction though?)


Better UX for creating labels

bug: Selecting all and moving it moves the labels wrong. moving a label with its corresponding point should not move the label exactly...

Tooltip hover takes to long to appear.
Give everything a little more of an Ivan Sutherland Sketchpad feel. I don't want to make my eyes bleed though so make it tasteful.

Create a panel on the far left that lists all the different files ordered by recently viewed. The save/load/reset functionality can call go in that panel too. I should be able to toggle that panel open and closed.




Make sure this works on an iPad with a stylus. Right click with apple pencil?
Make an app icon thing, make it work offline.


There should be a constraint to handle ambiguities. Maybe one value is larger than another or something. When there is more than one solution...

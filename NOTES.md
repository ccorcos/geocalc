There's a bug with the angle label rendering. The arc renders properly, but the actual degrees label never shows an angle > 180Â° and points to the wrong side of the angle when the angle is > 180.

I found a bug. The page shouldn't error if its too narrow. it doesnt have to work well on mobile but it shouldnt crash either.

Give everything a little more of an Ivan Sutherland Sketchpad feel. I don't want to make my eyes bleed though so make it tasteful.

Contact / Issues -> Github.

Deploy to github pages npm command (don't use github actions ci.)

More tools for later. Right click, new entity or constraint or something...
- bisector, midpoint (custom fraction though?)


Support undo/redo, just for state changes to geometry.

selection doesnt get set on mousedown. only mousemove / mouseup. That way clicking the background to make the constraint menu go away doesnt clear the selection before the menu disappears.


Create a panel on the far left that lists all the different files ordered by recently viewed. The save/load/reset functionality can call go in that panel too. I should be able to toggle that panel open and closed.




Make sure this works on an iPad with a stylus. Right click with apple pencil?
Make an app icon thing, make it work offline.


There should be a constraint to handle ambiguities. Maybe one value is larger than another or something. When there is more than one solution...

Notes
- shift+tab to auto-accept, and plan mode.
- @file will incluude the file without haveing to read them.
- claude --resume
- `#` will add to memory will in Claude.md

Strategies:
- make a plan in plans/yada.md.

selecting constraints should highlihgt the elements in the canvas.

red color of line vs circle vs point seem different. Lets consolidate and make sure they're the same.

Lets refactor all the colors into their own files so they can be easily tweaked (or just css variables)


blurry, retina distplay

 I should be able to set the initial scale of the drawing so that all the shapes are an appropriate size.


better ux for label and constraints. line vs two points, etc.
line dimensional drawing line lable goes too far

---

Saving documents. Import / Export. Automerge. Undo/redo. Collaboration.

selecting all and moving it moves the labels wrong. moving a label with its corresponding point should not move the label exactly...

- better colors. red vs green.

Line length constrating. Distance.

fixed radius + point on circle / tangent line

colinear (3+ points, or a line + points)
orthoganol-distance (line + point)
same-length (2+ lines)
same-radius (2+ circles)
bisector, midpoint (custom fraction though?)


Make sure this works on an iPad with a stylus. Right click with apple pencil?

The numbers in the legend seem blurry.

?Works yet?
Three points should be able to have a fixed angle


There should be a constraint to handle ambiguities. Maybe one value is larger than another or something. When there is more than one solution...

When I have two points that have a distance constraint, sometimes the point overshoots and ends up on the other side of the fixed point.


Testing...
I should be able to edit all the numbers in the panels
I should be able to cmd+click to fix things in place.
Tooltip hover takes to long to appear.
Give everything a little more of an Ivan Sutherland Sketchpad feel. I don't want to make my eyes bleed though so make it tasteful.

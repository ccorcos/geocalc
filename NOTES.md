the grid size can be a little wonky at times.


fix the end-to-end tests.

pinch zoom is too sensitive.
cmd+scroll to zoom (or option?)


Lets add a migration that persists the viewport scale, zoom, and position so that when you reload, you are looking at the same place in the model.

How hard would it be to support undo/redo?

Create a panel on the far left that lists all the different files ordered by recently viewed. The save/load/reset buttons can go at the bottom of that panel, and I should be able to toggle that panel open and closed.

the same constraints that apply to two points should also apply to a line, like distance.

New constraints.
colinear (3+ points, or a line + points)
orthoganol-distance (line + point)
same-length (2+ lines)
same-radius (2+ circles)
bisector, midpoint (custom fraction though?)

Better UX for creating labels

bug: Selecting all and moving it moves the labels wrong. moving a label with its corresponding point should not move the label exactly...

Make sure this works on an iPad with a stylus. Right click with apple pencil?

There should be a constraint to handle ambiguities. Maybe one value is larger than another or something. When there is more than one solution...

Tooltip hover takes to long to appear.
Give everything a little more of an Ivan Sutherland Sketchpad feel. I don't want to make my eyes bleed though so make it tasteful.
